<h1>Hello and Welcome</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to my website this a place where you can learn more about yours truely.</p>

<h3>Foster B. Stulen</h3>


<h2>Who am I?</h2>


<p>I am Foster Stulen the thrid. I am currently 21 years old as I was borned on Apirl 8th in 1997. I am currently a graduate of the Cincy Code IT .Net 
  Technical Bootcamp, that is looking for work to further devolop my skills as a Full stack developer in the .Net workshop and over workshops.
  I am eager to learn and always looking for something new to tackle and bring into my skill set.

  I am open to going to different places if there is a case to move somewhere to have a better oppurtunity although I would prefer to stay in
  the Cincinnati area for now, as this is where I am the most familar.

  I was a college student that realized I can not learn in theory but rather in praticality and in doing. Compared to doing the traditional
  college route in which students normally get an average of 120 hours of coding in a four year period, the Cincy Code IT bootcamp enabled me
  to have about 500 hours of hands on experience coding experience.
